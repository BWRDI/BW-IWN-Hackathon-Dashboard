The purpose of this project is to visualize key monitoring stations across various sites in the catchment area. 
These stations collect critical data on water quality, rainfall, streamflow, and other environmental factors. 
By mapping these stations, we can better understand the relationships between different monitoring sites and 
how data from these locations interact to provide insights into catchment health and management decisions.

- **Water Quality Stations**: Monitor critical parameters such as turbidity, pH, and nutrient concentrations.
- **Rainfall Stations**: Measure precipitation to track storm events and their impact on streamflow and water quality.
- **Streamflow Stations**: Provide data on the flow of water through rivers and streams, allowing for the analysis of hydrological patterns.
